                             for loop
in while we specify condition but in for loop we dont specify the condition 
for loop mostly used for sequence or string such as list stack tupple where we need to print the value of sequence one by one 

syntax of for loop 

for i(variable name) in (sequencer name):
   print(i)
i will refer to one element at a time initially it will refer to first element in the then second and so one by one it will fetch the value
 
a=[1,2,3,34]
for i in a:
    print(i)
   
a='manumanu'
for i in a:
    print(i,end='')


a='manumanu'

i=0
while i<len(a):
    print(a[i],end="")
    i+=1
