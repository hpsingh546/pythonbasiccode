                               Array
it is collection of similar type of element example collection of all int,float,char array in python they dont have specific size(fixed size ) which mean you can expand or shrink it
it has certain method which we can use 

In order to create an array we have to import a module called array in which we called function array in which we have to pass two thing
1. typecode which mean type of array which we want to create and
2. array element in square bracket and
it return array array 
import array as ar
val=ar.array('i',[39,20])
#for i in range(len(val)): we pass the index of array in val
 #   print(val[i])
#for i in val:in this case it directly point to array value
 #   print(i)
newval=ar.array(val.typecode,(i*i for i in val))
in which we pass tuple value as array
or
newval=ar.array(val.typecode,[i*i for i in val])
in which we pass array value as list

in above statement it wil take typecode of previous array and take one value i at a time and assign to new array we can also perform operation on new value
print(newval)
i=0
while i<len(newval):
    print(newval[i])
    i+=1
print the value of array using while
