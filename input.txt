                          input from user
input(prompt=None, /)
Read a string from standard input. The prompt string, if given, is printed to standard output without a trailing newline before reading input.
in simple word this function read string from input console and wty[e have to typecast into the datatype which we need 

a=int(input("enter the number\n"))
this statement take input as string and convert it into number 

eval function is used to calculate expression
a=eval(input("enter the expression")
print(a)
if you want to pass value from cmd we use argv which define in module sys and take value as sring

code
import sys
a=int(sys.argv[1])
b=int(sys.argv[2])
print(a+b)
